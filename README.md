# README

This is a program that allows a user to play rock, paper, scissors with the computer. The game lasts five rounds, and for each round, the player is prompted to enter rock, paper, or scissors. After each round, the console prints the results of the round. When five rounds are played, the console prints whether the computer or the player won. This program will later move out of the console.
